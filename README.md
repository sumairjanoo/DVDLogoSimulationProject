# DVD Logo Simulation Project

## Overview
This project simulates the classic DVD logo screensaver using Python and Pygame. The logo moves around the screen, bouncing off edges and changing color when it hits. It tracks corner hits, visualizes the path, and adjusts speed dynamically.

## Key Features
- Dynamic movement and color changes.
- Corner detection with real-time feedback.
- Adjustable speed via keyboard input.
- Bounce tracking with predictions for corner hits.

## Installation
```bash
pip install pygame
python dvd_simulation.py
```

## Usage
- **UP Arrow**: Speed up.
- **DOWN Arrow**: Slow down.
- Close window to end the simulation.

## Future Improvements
- Support custom logos and screen sizes.
- Enhance corner hit recording and visualization.
